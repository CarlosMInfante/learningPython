# Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?  Make a list that
# includes at least three people you'd like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to prin a message to each person,
# inviting them to dinner.
# Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can't make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set
# of invitations.  You'll have to think of someone else to invite.
# More Guests: You found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available.  Think of three more guests to invite.
# Shrinking Guest List: You just found that your new dinner table won't arrive in time for the dinner, and you have
# space for only two guests.
