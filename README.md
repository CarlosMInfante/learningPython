# learningPython
This is going to be a repo for my learning Python process.  This will include any books I read or courses I take.  I 
will create other Python repos for any projects I try, but my "course" learning will be done here.

The way I plan on setting this up right now is each book will get its own directory.
In each directory I will have it broken down by chapter.  That will break down to instruction lead and self attempt.
